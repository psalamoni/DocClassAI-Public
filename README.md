# DocclassAI
DocclassAI is a developed tool to classify printed documents using AI as a recognition tool for document layouts

## Introduction
According to the present scenario of world's development, many countries are switching the document platform from physical to digital. In this process, many physical documents are getting forgotten in warehouses increasing the access facility.  
In order to update those documents and bringing in to the digital platform, companies are digitalizing it and disposing a huge effort to classify them.

## Features
Based on the demand on classifying physical documents, DocclassAI become the innovative tool to classify physical documents through the power of AI image recognition. By the layout of every document, this tool is able to evaluate the odds of being the target document.  
The software is developed for every company that are developing a digitalizing process and want to make a data mining in order to recognise pattern in importants documents. Specially developed for public sector, the software are able to recognise Construction Permit, Demolition Permit, Dwell Permit, and many others.

## Data
For trainning of Artificial Intelligence, there will be used models of a local Public Organization. Within raw doccuments, the AI will be trainned for:

- Construction License
- Backside of Construction License
- Inhabit License
- Backside of Inhabit License
- Localization License
- Previous License
- Implantation License
- Operation License

For data collecting, it has being extracted from proccess and being merged with other non-aimed doccuments.

## Technologies
In order to execute the Artificial Intelligence, it was used:

CSV Library - The most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases.
PyPDF2 - For extracting data from PDF files, or manipulate existing PDFs to produce a new file
Keras - High-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
Numpy - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Pandas - Easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
